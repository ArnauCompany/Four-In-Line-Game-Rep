# Four-In-Line Game
Welcome to the Four-In-Line Game! This repository contains the code for a classic two-player game where the objective is to connect four pieces in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Currently, the game is designed for one player versus the machine.

## Rules

The game follows the following rules:

The game is played on a 6x7 grid.
The player (using "X" as their piece) and the AI opponent (using "O" as its piece) take turns placing their pieces on the grid.
Players can only place their pieces in a column that is not full.
The objective is to connect four pieces of the same kind in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
The game ends when either the player or the computer opponent wins or the grid is completely filled (resulting in a draw).

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to incorporate artificial intelligence techniques to enhance the game. This will involve developing an AI algorithm that can play against human players with increasing levels of difficulty, providing a challenging and engaging gaming experience.
